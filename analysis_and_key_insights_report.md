## Analysis Strategy Rationale

These five analyses were selected to answer critical business questions:

| Business Question                                      | Analysis Used                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Are we spending more over time?                        | Monthly Expense Trends             |
| What are our biggest cost drivers?                     | Top Expense Categories             |
| Which departments are the most cost-intensive?         | Departmental Average Spending      |
| Are there any suspicious or unusual expenses?          | Anomaly Detection                  |
| How do spending patterns shift by category?            | Category Trends Over Time          |

These queries cover **descriptive analytics** (what happened), with potential extensions into **diagnostic** (why), **predictive** (what will happen), and **prescriptive** (what should be done).

## Final Thoughts

If applied to a real business, this analysis would:

- Provide finance teams with a reliable data-driven foundation for decision-making.
- Help prevent revenue leaks through early anomaly detection.
- Empower managers with insights for cost control and strategic budget planning.
- Serve as a model for building automated reporting and auditing pipelines using SQL.

This report could be extended into a Power BI dashboard or Python-based reporting system to enhance visualization and automation.
